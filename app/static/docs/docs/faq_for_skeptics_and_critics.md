# FAQ for Skeptics and Critics

This document addresses common concerns, misunderstandings,
and critical questions about HODLXXI.

It is written for readers who are cautious, unconvinced,
or professionally skeptical.

---

## Is this just another crypto project?

No.

HODLXXI does not introduce a token, a blockchain, or an asset.
It does not seek liquidity, speculation, or network effects.

Bitcoin is used as an underlying primitive for time and verifiability,
not as a platform for financial instruments.

---

## Who controls this system?

No one.

There is no administrator with special privileges.
There is no authority capable of overriding rules.

Any implementation can be forked, abandoned, or replaced.
The system must remain functional without its original creators.

---

## Where is the incentive to participate?

Participation is voluntary.

The system does not promise rewards.
It alters the cost structure of long-term interaction.

For some agents, predictability and durable commitments
are more valuable than short-term optionality.

For others, the system will be irrelevant.

Both outcomes are acceptable.

---

## Is this surveillance or social credit?

No.

HODLXXI does not attempt to observe or score behavior exhaustively.

Only voluntary, explicit actions become visible.
There is no background monitoring, profiling, or inference.

There is no universal reputation score.

---

## Does this try to "fix" human behavior?

No.

The system does not define correct behavior.
It does not enforce morality.
It does not align values.

It only makes certain consequences persistent over time.

Agents remain free to act irrationally, defect, or exit.

---

## Is this a governance framework?

No.

HODLXXI does not resolve disputes or establish authority.
It does not produce binding decisions for all participants.

Forking is preferred over forced consensus.
Exit is preferred over coercion.

---

## What happens if someone uses this system maliciously?

Misuse is possible.

No system can prevent all harmful use.
HODLXXI does not attempt to do so.

Its design goal is narrower:
to make long-term misuse increasingly costly and visible,
without removing agency or exit.

---

## Why 21 years?

Because human systems operate on human time.

Shorter horizons optimize for short-term behavior.
Longer horizons align with generational responsibility.

Twenty-one years approximates the minimum time
required for a human to grow, mature, and understand consequences.

---

## Is this scientifically proven?

No.

HODLXXI is not a closed scientific theory.
It is an applied research framework.

Some components are well-established
(game theory, cryptography, distributed systems).
Others are exploratory.

Claims are limited to what the architecture can enforce,
not to predicted outcomes.

---

## Is this compatible with existing legal systems?

HODLXXI does not replace law.

It operates orthogonally to legal systems.
Participation does not imply legal standing or enforceability.

Any interaction with legal frameworks is contextual and optional.

---

## Why not use existing identity systems?

Most identity systems optimize for:
- control,
- monetization,
- or central governance.

HODLXXI optimizes for:
- exit,
- durability,
- and symmetry of rules.

These goals are often incompatible.

---

## Who should not use this?

Anyone seeking:
- profit guarantees,
- influence over others,
- behavioral control,
- or certainty of outcomes.

The system offers none of these.

---

## Why make this public?

Because opacity creates power asymmetry.

All assumptions, constraints, and limitations
are documented to allow critique, rejection, or independent reuse.

This project does not require belief.
Only inspection.

---

## Summary

HODLXXI is not a solution to human coordination.

It is a tool for exploring whether
long-term, voluntary commitments
can be made observable without authority.

Skepticism is expected.
Critique is welcome.
Adoption is optional.
