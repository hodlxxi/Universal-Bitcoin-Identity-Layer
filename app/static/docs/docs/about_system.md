# About the System

This system is not designed to be correct.
It is designed to be constrained.

It does not assume alignment.
It does not assume goodwill.
It does not assume rationality in the short term.

It assumes only that:
- time progresses,
- actions have consequences,
- and identities can persist.

The system does not promise cooperation.
It does not guarantee safety.
It does not prevent misuse.

It only makes certain actions
more expensive over time,
and certain commitments
harder to erase.

The system does not know what should happen.
It does not optimize toward a final state.
It does not converge on a single outcome.

Its only purpose
is to remain inspectable,
forkable,
and survivable without its creators.

If it becomes useful, that use will be local.
If it becomes harmful, that harm should be visible.
If it becomes irrelevant, it should be allowed to fade.

Any system that requires constant defense,
explanation, or justification
has already failed its purpose.

This system exists
to make long-term responsibility possible,
not inevitable.
