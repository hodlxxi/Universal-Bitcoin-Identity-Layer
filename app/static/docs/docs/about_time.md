# About Time (Long-Horizon Orientation)

This project operates on time scales
where feedback is delayed and incomplete.

Short-term evaluation is misleading.
Early signals are unreliable.
Immediate outcomes are not representative.

The absence of validation is not evidence of failure.
The presence of enthusiasm is not evidence of success.

Time will introduce:
- reinterpretation,
- misuse,
- partial forgetting,
- and accidental rediscovery.

These are not errors.
They are properties of long-lived systems.

The system must be able to survive:
- being ignored,
- being misunderstood,
- and being rediscovered without context.

If the project requires continuity of attention,
it is fragile.

If it requires constant correction,
it is unstable.

The correct pace is slow.
The correct signal is persistence without amplification.

I do not need to accelerate time.
I need to respect it.

The system is allowed to remain incomplete.
Completion is not the goal.

Survival of constraints is.
