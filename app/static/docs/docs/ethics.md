# Ethics

HODLXXI frames ethics as constraints, not enforcement.
Implementations should make these boundaries explicit.

## Voluntary Participation

- Joining, forking, and exiting must remain available at all times.
- No implementation should imply social or institutional coercion.

## Transparency

- Rules, code, and data flows should be inspectable.
- Changes must be disclosed; hidden policy shifts are non-compliant.

## Minimal Claims

- Avoid promises of safety, profit, or legitimacy.
- Representations must match what the software can verifiably deliver.

## Data Handling

- Observe only what participants intentionally reveal.
- Do not infer or aggregate hidden reputational scores.
- Respect local privacy laws; the research framework does not grant exemptions.

## Attribution

- Credit original research and prior art.
- Clearly separate HODLXXI concepts from implementation-specific features.
