# Research Status

HODLXXI is an ongoing research project.
It examines whether long-term coordination can be supported by cryptographic commitments without centralized authority.

## Current Phase

- Conceptual framework and threat model drafted.
- Reference materials available for review.
- Implementations exist, but none are canonical or endorsed.

## Evidence and Testing

- No formal proofs of effectiveness.
- No large-scale adversarial testing.
- Results are implementation-dependent and should be reported with context.

## Open Questions

- How do time-locked commitments interact with real-world incentives?
- What privacy guarantees remain under sustained observation?
- Which governance patterns, if any, preserve exit and forkability over decades?

## Expectations

- Failure is a valid outcome.
- Fragmentation and competing interpretations are expected.
- Claims should be limited to what can be reproduced and verified in code.
