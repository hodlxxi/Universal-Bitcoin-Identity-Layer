# Limits

This document summarizes the hard limits and uncertainties of HODLXXI.
They apply to the research framework and to any implementation inspired by it.

## Scope of Validity

- Guarantees are limited to what can be enforced by cryptography and transparent code.
- Social outcomes, adoption, and economic value are outside the project’s control.
- Implementations may diverge; no deployment is authoritative.

## Participation Boundaries

- Participation is voluntary and reversible; exit must remain possible.
- No whitelists, privileged accounts, or hidden roles are assumed.
- Implementers are responsible for making local constraints explicit.

## Security and Privacy

- Privacy is contextual and implementation-dependent; anonymity is not promised.
- Key custody rests with participants; lost keys cannot be recovered.
- Time-locked commitments are irreversible once published.

## Operational Considerations

- Uptime, responsiveness, and support quality vary by implementer.
- Integrations (e.g., Bitcoin Core, Lightning, OAuth) depend on external software and may fail.
- No service-level agreement is provided by the research project itself.

## Interpretation

These limits are non-negotiable constraints, not optional guidelines.
If an implementation removes or weakens them, it should not be presented as HODLXXI-compliant.
