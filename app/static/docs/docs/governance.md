# Governance

HODLXXI does not prescribe a governance mechanism.
It treats governance as local, reversible, and non-authoritative.

## Core Positions

- No canonical deployment or steering committee.
- Forking is the default response to disagreement.
- Rules should be encoded, inspectable, and changeable by those who run the software.

## Implementation Guidance

- Avoid privilege hierarchies that cannot be exited.
- Publish upgrade paths and downgrade options.
- Document how disputes are handled; do not rely on implicit trust.

## Non-Goals

- No voting system is provided for “truth” or “legitimacy.”
- No promise of stable policy across implementations.
- No attempt to optimize social outcomes globally.
