# HODLXXI

## What this is
HODLXXI is a Bitcoin-native research framework for studying long-term coordination with cryptographic identity, time-locked commitments, and voluntary participation.  
This repository is document-first: it collects research notes, constraints, and reference materials so implementations can be inspected and challenged.

## What this is not
- Not a token or investment vehicle
- Not a finished product or hosted service
- Not a canonical identity provider (implementations such as KeyAuth are independent)
- Not a governance authority or source of policy

## How to read this project
1. Start with `/docs/what_this_project_is_not` and `/docs/limits` for boundaries.
2. Review `/docs/research_status` and `/docs/threat_model_and_failure_modes` for scope and risk.
3. Continue with `/docs/how_it_works` and `/docs/architecture` for conceptual flow.
4. Use `/docs/academic_references_and_prior_art` for citations and context.

## Implementations
Any running service is non-canonical. KeyAuth is one independent implementation and may diverge from the research materials; use it for experimentation, not authority. Always verify behavior in the code you operate.

## Status
Active research with open questions and expected failure modes. Forks and alternative interpretations are welcome and expected.
