# HODLXXI

HODLXXI is a Bitcoin-native research framework
exploring long-term coordination through
cryptographic identity, time-locked commitments,
and voluntary participation.

This repository contains research documents,
design constraints, and reference materials.

---

## What This Is

HODLXXI is an applied research effort.

It studies whether durable cooperation
can emerge over long human time horizons
without central authority,
using cryptographic primitives
and explicit exit mechanisms.

It is not a finished system.
It is not a protocol specification.
It is not a product.

---

## What This Is Not

- Not a token
- Not a DAO
- Not an identity provider
- Not a governance platform
- Not an optimization framework
- Not a promise of outcomes

Participation is voluntary.
Forking is expected.
Exit is always allowed.

## How to Read This Project

This project is intentionally document-first.

Start here:

1. `docs/what_this_project_is_not.md`
2. `docs/limits.md`
3. `docs/research_status.md`

Then continue with:

- `docs/manifesto.md`
- `docs/cryptographic_reciprocity_theory.md`
- `docs/principles_and_invariants.md`

For critical review:

- `docs/threat_model_and_failure_modes.md`
- `docs/ethics.md`
- `docs/governance.md`

## Implementations

This repository does not define a canonical implementation.

Any running service (e.g. KeyAuth)
is an independent implementation inspired by these ideas
and does not represent the framework itself.

---

## Status

HODLXXI is an active research project.

Claims are limited to what is
architecturally enforceable.
Failure, misuse, and irrelevance
are accepted outcomes.
