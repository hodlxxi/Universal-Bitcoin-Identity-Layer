# What This Project Is NOT

This document exists to prevent misunderstanding.

HODLXXI is intentionally easy to misinterpret.
It uses familiar words — identity, trust, reputation —
but applies them in fundamentally different ways.

The following statements define what this project explicitly is NOT.

---

## Not a Company

HODLXXI is not a startup, corporation, or service provider.

There is no central operator responsible for outcomes.
There are no customer accounts, no SLAs, and no promises of continuity.

Any implementation may cease to exist.
The concepts do not depend on a single deployment.

---

## Not a Financial Product

HODLXXI is not an investment vehicle.

There is no token sale.
No yield.
No expectation of profit.

Participation does not imply financial return.
No future value is promised or implied.

Any financial mechanisms used are structural, not speculative.

---

## Not a Token or Coin

HODLXXI does not introduce a new blockchain asset.

There is no governance token.
No utility token.
No incentive token.

Bitcoin is used as an underlying primitive,
not as a substrate for issuing new assets.

---

## Not a Social Network

HODLXXI is not designed for content, engagement, or attention.

There are no feeds.
No likes.
No virality mechanics.

Presence is functional, not expressive.
Identity is cryptographic, not performative.

---

## Not a Reputation Score

HODLXXI does not reduce individuals to numerical ratings.

There is no single trust score.
No universal ranking.
No global leaderboard of value.

Reputation is contextual, historical, and incomplete by design.

---

## Not an Optimization Engine for Humans

The system does not attempt to improve, optimize, or correct people.

It does not define desirable behavior.
It does not enforce morality.
It does not align values.

It only alters the cost structure of actions over time.

---

## Not a Governance System

HODLXXI does not claim to solve governance.

There is no voting system that determines truth or correctness.
There is no authority that resolves disputes globally.

Forking is preferred to forced consensus.

---

## Not Surveillance

The system does not aim to observe everything.

Only voluntary actions become visible.
Private behavior remains private.

No hidden profiling is performed.
No behavioral inference is assumed.

---

## Not Permissioned Access

There is no whitelist.
No approval committee.
No required identity verification beyond cryptographic proof.

Participation is opt-in.
Exit is always allowed.

---

## Not a Replacement for Law, Society, or Trust

HODLXXI does not replace legal systems.
It does not replace human judgment.
It does not replace trust.

It provides a narrow tool:
the ability to make long-term commitments observable and durable.

Nothing more.

---

## Not Finished

The project is incomplete by design.

Any claim of finality, authority, or completion
should be treated as a misunderstanding or misuse.

---
